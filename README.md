# FSGS
Our proposed solution is to solve the big data transaction problem, which is based on smart contracts, digital watermarks and blockchains. Through the solution we proposed, we can solve some problems in the current big data transaction.  This code mainly implements all the functions of the smart contract proposed in our paper.  The image shows the FSGS we designed. The left area shows the operation interface, the lower right area shows the block information (including transaction information), and the upper right area is the code area.  Specific introduction of how to use FSGS. It includes the processes, operator interfaces and error handling methods of FSGS.
